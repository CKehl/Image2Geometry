When you are using the "Image2Geometry" code in your project (or as inspiration to your own development), cite at least one the two two following items (depending on the content you relate to):

Kehl, C., Buckley, S.J., Viseur, S., Gawthorpe, R.L. & Howell, J.A. "Automatic Illumination-Invariant Image-to-Geometry Registration in Outdoor Environments", *The Photogrammetric Record*, 32(158), **_2017_**

Kehl, C., Buckley, S.J., Gawthorpe, R.L., Viola, I. & Howell, J.A. "DIRECT IMAGE-TO-GEOMETRY REGISTRATION USING MOBILE SENSOR DATA", *ISPRS Annals of Photogrammetry, Remote Sensing \& Spatial Information Sciences*, 3(2), p. 121-128, **_2016_**

When using the gamma adaptation and the Wallis filter, you may also be interested in the following article:

Kehl, C. & Buckley, S.J. "Automatic Image-to-Geometry Registration in Varying Illumination Conditions using Local Descriptors", *Proc. 3D-NordOst*, vol. 19, p. 151-160, **_2016_**

If you compare your image-prefiltering results for Image-to-Geometry registration with our previous results, I also suggest citing the article above.
