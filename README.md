# Image2Geometry
Implementation of PHOR paper image-to-geometry registration method in C++ on common desktop computers for result replication.

# Disclaimer
This repository is **not** containing the "Geological Registration and Interpretation Toolset" (GRIT) for mobile devices, as that software is kind-of behind a paywall from petroleum industry consortium funding institutions and companies - sorry to disappoint, but I have little hope this will *ever* get public.

This repository only includes the specific image-to-geometry registration method published openly in "The Photogrammetric Record" (volume 32, issue 158) and in the ISPRS Annals (volume 3, issue 2) and related academic publications (see CITATION.md). As such, and as part of an also publically-funded project, it is my obligation and priviledge to provide a reference implementation of how we do the 2D-3D registation for mobile devices. The code is *just* a simple and straight end-to-end implementation without any precautions on engineering finesse or runtime improvement.

The provided license applies to further usage, embedding and sharing (and alike) of this specific software.
